## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}


outpath <- '~/Dropbox/work/CHL5209H_2016/data'
dataset <- read.csv2(file.path(outpath, 'finrisk82.csv'), colClasses='character')


d = read.csv("http://individual.utoronto.ca/osaarela/finrisk82.csv")

str(d)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
